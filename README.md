# Block Simmulation

# Overview 
A simple simmulation of momentum, fiction, and gravity. 


# Usage 

Go to https://trey722.github.io/Block_Simmulation/ to use. 

# Features


## Adding Blocks 
Use the + button to  add blocsk to the simmualiton

You don't need to type in both a velocity or mass,

```
  TIP: IT is reccomeneded that you keep velocity less then or equal to 50. 
```


```
  TIP: Mass doesn't matter as long as when you use several blocks. There are with 100 of each other
```

## Changing coefficent of friction and gravity 

Use the deit button in the top right to do this. 

You need both a gravity and new coeefecnt of friciton for the input to be valid. 

Coeeficent of friciton will manage energy loss. 

```
  TIP: Coeeficent of friciton should stay between 0 and 1. Anything higher will lead to weird results.
```

```
  TIP: Gravity will only have an effect if coeeficent of friciton is brought in due to laws of phsycis.
